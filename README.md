#  GrGenCore

This is a port of the core libaries of [GrGen.NET](https://github.com/ejaku/grgen) from .NET Framework to .NET 8.0.

The main change is a switch to Roslyn for the runtime assembly compilation, as the old Compiling libraries had been removed from modern .NET.

This work is made available under the LGPL.
